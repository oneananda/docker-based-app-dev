### **What is Docker?**

Docker is a platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. These containers can run consistently on any system that supports Docker, whether it's your local machine, a cloud server, or even a fellow developer's laptop.

### **Key Concepts**

#### **1. Containers**
- A **container** is a lightweight, standalone, and executable unit that includes everything an application needs to run: code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.
- Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, ensuring that "it works on my machine" is no longer a problem.

#### **2. Images**
- An **image** is a blueprint for a container. It defines what’s inside the container, such as the OS, application code, and dependencies.
- Images are **immutable**, meaning they don't change once created.

#### **3. Dockerfile**
- A **Dockerfile** is a text document that contains instructions for building a Docker image. Think of it as a recipe for your container.

#### **4. Docker Hub**
- Docker Hub is a public registry where developers can store and share Docker images. You can also pull pre-built images (like `node`, `nginx`, etc.) from Docker Hub.

#### **5. Volumes**
- **Volumes** are a way to persist data generated by and used by containers. By default, data inside a container is ephemeral—it disappears when the container stops.

### **Why Use Docker?**

1. **Consistency**: Run applications in any environment without worrying about compatibility.
2. **Isolation**: Applications and their dependencies are isolated from the host system and each other.
3. **Scalability**: Containers can be easily scaled horizontally (more containers) or vertically (bigger containers).
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight and efficient compared to virtual machines.

### **Basic Docker Workflow**

1. **Write a Dockerfile**
   - Define how to package your application.

2. **Build an Image**
   - Use the `docker build` command to create an image from the Dockerfile.

3. **Run a Container**
   - Use the `docker run` command to start a container from the image.

4. **Share the Image**
   - Push the image to a registry like Docker Hub.

### **Important Commands**

#### **1. Installing Docker**
To install Docker on your system, refer to the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

#### **2. Verifying Installation**
```bash
docker --version
```

#### **3. Running Your First Container**
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
- This command downloads the `hello-world` image from Docker Hub and runs it in a container.

#### **4. Listing Running Containers**
```bash
docker ps
```

#### **5. Stopping a Container**
```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

### **Basic Example: Running Nginx**

1. Pull the Nginx image from Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker pull nginx
   ```

2. Run the Nginx container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8085:80 nginx
   ```

3. Access the Nginx server in your browser at `http://localhost:8085`.

4. Stop and remove the container:
   ```bash
   docker stop <container_id>
   docker rm <container_id>
   ```
